## In order to test/use it:
- Make sure you have Docker installed
- Make sure ports **8000** and **5434** are not used on your local machine
- Clone the repository to any directory on your local machine
- **cd** into the directory that contains the cloned repo in command line and run the following command there
```
docker-compose -f online_python_school.yml up
```
- Wait until all containers are up and running (it usually takes approximately 1-2 minutes)
- Open a browser and go to **localhost:8000**
